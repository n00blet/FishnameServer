# Setup Project

Assuming that you have docker installed and running in your system, this is how you can run the application from the 
project root folder.

```
make all
```

This will install requirements for the project and runs pytests <br>
After the above two steps are done, it will create a docker instance of the application running at ```0.0.0.0:8000```


# Run locally
- To run the code locally, you need to have a postgres instance running in the background with db fishnames.
- You also need to update DB configs in either ```.env``` or edit ```session.py``` pointing to your DB instance.
- To install python requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- To run the project from base dir: ```uvicorn "src.api.main:app" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level "debug"```
